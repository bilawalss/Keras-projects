30 epochs:

VGGbasicNetwork.py with sgd lr - 0.0005 : 78%
VGGbasicNetwork.py with sgd lr - 0.001 : 84%
With more layers, 0.01 gives better accuracy than 0.0005
VGGbasicNetwork.py with rmsprop with dropout 0.25 in all layers : 87.315%
VGGbasicNetwork.py with rmsprop with dropout 0.5 in all layers : 79.2%
